1. Use Loop to generate 14 red tiles

2. Check dimensions and whether tile sizing seems to match:
    (reference image dims) = (442, 638) => ratio w/h => 0.69
    current w/h ration => 1.006
        -> change the value of x and height of the tiles


Archive:
- use variable borders to easily adjust the value.
        - x = 10, y = 10
        - player = 60, 30
        - Screen = 906, 900
        - Colored tiles (14 x 4)
            - tilespacing = 1px 


Interesting things to maybe look at:

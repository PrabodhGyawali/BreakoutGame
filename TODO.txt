1. Change the height of the tiles

2. Fix the discretization issue with borders.

    - Learn about SurfArray in numpy
        - Imagine a 3D array
            - a 2D screen of pixel by pixel
            - where there is an RGB tuple within the 2D array

3. Change dimensions to ensure values are of type integer.

Archive:
- Width to heigh ratio = 0.69
    
- use variable borders to easily adjust the value.
        - x = 6.9, y = 10
        - player = 2
        - Screen = 906, 900
        - Colored tiles (14 x 4)
            - tilespacing = 1px

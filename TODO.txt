1. Change the dimension of the borders to fit the size of the player tiles and borders
    - use variable borders to easily adjust the value.
        - x = 10, y = 10
        - player.rect = 60, 30
        - Screen_width = (60 * 14) + tilespacing + 40 = 906
        

Archive:
Colored tiles (14 x 4)
    - tilespacing = 1px 
        - (2 x 13) = 26 px  // space between each tile
    - ((720 - 40) - 26)/ 14 = 46.17px
        - 
    - red, orange, green , yellow

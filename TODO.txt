1. Fix penetration problem with bounce
2. Change color of the ball when it moves across colors

Interesting things to look into:
    - garbage collection in different programming languages
    - freeing up memory space when game restarts



Unsuccessful: Create a ball bouncing algorithm to bounce of many different angles

1. NOTE: Tuples are immutable unlike lists
2. Understanding the loop sequence and how the game runs
    - pygame.display.flip()
    - pygame.time.delay(20) 
- tile_array[j].append(pygame.draw.rect(screen, COLORS[j], pygame.Rect(
                    x*1 + (i*x*4) + i*space,
                    y*20 + k*x*1.5 + k*space +2*j*x*1.5 + 2*j*space,    // k -> 2 rows with same color // j -> different colors
                    x*4, 
                    y*1.5)))

- use variable borders to easily adjust the value.
        - x = 10, y = 10 // MUST BE AN INTEGER value
        - player = 2
        - Screen = 906, 900
        - Colored tiles (14 x 4)
            - tilespacing = 1px 
            - tile.size() = (4,2)

        - Imagine a 3D array
            - a 2D screen of pixel by pixel
            - where there is an RGB tuple within the 2D array
